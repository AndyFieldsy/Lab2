Hey, I'm Andy. This is my second assignment for my code 201. I'm still learning
so please be gentle!

I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be typing here, 
I'm sure I'll see in my grades what if I did something wrong.

I chose to not add much style to this with CSS, I did however keep some of the
work I had done during class to add this button below.

        <main>
            <section>
                <div>
                    <div class="slider-checkbox">
                        <input id="slider" type="checkbox">
                        <label for="slider"></label>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>
        </main>
        <footer>Click this for good luck.</footer>
